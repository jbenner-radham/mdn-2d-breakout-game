Setup
-----

### Install Dependencies
```sh
$ yarn install
```

### Compiles and Hot-reloads for Development
```sh
$ yarn serve
```

Rationale
---------
> Why is this a [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) based project?
> You're not really using [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) itself for anything!

That's a fair question. I'm simply familiar with the toolset and wanted to
scaffold out a project base quickly and with minimal configuration. It most
assuredly adds unneeded overhead but since I was just doing a tutorial for
learning purposes it wasn't a concern.
